Important Notes about the Quad (by Yoonchang Sung)

- Commands:
	roslaunch mavros px4.launch fcu_url:=/dev/ttyUSB0:921600

- ARYA:
	ssh arya@192.168.0.130

- SANSA:
	ssh sansa@192.168.0.150
	Sansa has a warning message saying "WARNING: NEW QUAD ALGORITHM REQUESTED, BUT COMPILED WITHOUT CGAL SUPPORT, FALLING BACK TO OLD ALGORITHM." We need to fix it by installing CGAL properly.

- QGroundControl:
	When you get the permission error, then type the following command.
	sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0

- Antenna
	1) bullet: password: SN-00001

- Apriltag packages:
	We need to install two packages.
	1) https://github.com/swatbotics/apriltags-cpp
		This contains plain CMake. Presumably that's why Ashish used "catkin build" instead of "catkin_make".
	2) https://github.com/personalrobotics/apriltags

- Run the camera
	roslaunch flea3 single_node.launch device:=15291221 (For Sansa)
	roslaunch flea3 single_node.launch device:=17089332 (For Arya)

- Lidar (lidar lite v3)
	manual: http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-rangefinder-lidarlite.html
	In QGroundControl, search for "LL40" to check if the lidar is diabled or PWM.

- Camera and IMU Calibration (Kalibr)
	https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/wiki
	Note that when you run the calibration step, make sure you do NOT have necessary files in the kalibr-cde folder. It won't work.

- Camera (Flea3), Lense (Tamron)
	1) Lense has two knobs: Upper knob is for focus. Lower one is for aperture.
	2) Installation: Refer to https://github.com/KumarRobotics/flea3
		You need to download 'FlyCapture2' from https://www.ptgrey.com/support/downloads You will get flea3 folder that contains required files.
		Then, look up the README

- TF problem we encountered: Find "global_origin".
	1) Kalibr_Mocap/src/mavros/mavros_extras/launc/px4_mocap_config.yaml: Change the frame_id from "local_origin" to "global_origin". Then, change the child_frame_id from "fcu" to "fcu_utm".
	2) In tf_bcast.cpp, cam2imu_publish() has sendTransform() at the end. Change "fcu" to "fcu_utm".
	3) Have transformPose() in tf_bcast.cpp and set "global_origin"

- Useful commands
	1. ps -elf : To see what resources are running.
	2. find . | grep 'name'
	3. grep -R 'name' 
	4. dmesg : It tells what has changed with the USB ports.

- UTM Issues
	1) GPS (Latitude and longitude to UTM coordinates converter)
		https://www.geoplaner.com
		http://www.synnatschke.de/geo-tools/coordinate-converter.php
	2) Coordinates
		1. In Pixhawk, NED (North-East-Down)
		2. In Mavros, ENU (East-North-Up)

- Rosbag Issues
	1) Recording
		rosbag record -a -x "(.*)/compressed(.*)"
	2) Playing
		- time sync issue
			1. First, add <param name="/use_sim_time" value="true"/> in your launch file.
			2. rosbag play (bag file name) --clock --topics (rostopic names)

- Git: submodules
	1) When cloning, do the following: 
		git clone --recursive git@github.com:raaslab/mavros_mrmt_tracking.git

- Generate custom messages in Matlab for Ros
	1. The most important!: you should start matlab with sudo.

- Everything about APM
	1) Network password of reach:63:05 - emlidreach
		In order to check the wifi setup for Reach RTK, connect to RTK's wifi then go to http://192.168.42.1/
		If you can't see the wifi from your network, then it means RTK talks to the antenna, which is good.
	2) rosservice call /mavros/set_stream_rate 0 10 1
	3) RC modes
		1. Loiter mode = Position Hold
		2. Stabilization mode = Manual mode
	4) Mission Planner
		1. EK2_ALT_SOURCE: it selects which sensor we should rely on for altitude.



1. Guided mode check: run waypoint controller on the second floor. The waypoint in this case is zero. See what message pops up.


Questions about APM:
	1. Why can I see satelites in the lab? Is it correct?

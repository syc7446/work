Important Notes (by Yoonchang Sung)

<Commands>
	roslaunch mavros px4.launch fcu_url:=/dev/ttyUSB0:921600

<Quads>
	- ARYA:
		ssh arya@192.168.0.130

	- SANSA:
		ssh sansa@192.168.0.150
		Sansa has a warning message saying "WARNING: NEW QUAD ALGORITHM REQUESTED, BUT COMPILED WITHOUT CGAL SUPPORT, FALLING BACK TO OLD ALGORITHM." We hope to fix it by installing CGAL properly.

<QGroundControl>
	When you get the permission error, then type the following command.
	sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyUSB0

<Antenna>
	1. bullet: password: SN-00001

<Apriltag_packages>
	We need to install two packages.
	1. https://github.com/swatbotics/apriltags-cpp
		This contains plain CMake. Presumably that's why Ashish used "catkin build" instead of "catkin_make".
	2. https://github.com/personalrobotics/apriltags

<Lidar> (lidar lite v3)
	manual: http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-rangefinder-lidarlite.html
	In QGroundControl, search for "LL40" to check if the lidar is diabled or PWM.

<Camera_and_IMU_calibration> (Kalibr)
	https://github.com/ethz-asl/kalibr/wiki
	Note that when you run the calibration step, make sure you do NOT have necessary files in the kalibr-cde folder. It won't work.

<Camera_issues>
	- Camera (Flea3), Lense (Tamron)
		1) Lense has two knobs: Upper knob is for focus. Lower one is for aperture.
		2) Installation: Refer to https://github.com/KumarRobotics/flea3
			You need to download 'FlyCapture2' from https://www.ptgrey.com/support/downloads You will get flea3 folder that contains required files.
			Then, look up the README.
	- roslaunch flea3 single_node.launch device:=15291221 (For Sansa)
	- roslaunch flea3 single_node.launch device:=17089332 (For Arya)

<TF_issues>
	- TF problem we encountered: Find "global_origin".
		1. Kalibr_Mocap/src/mavros/mavros_extras/launc/px4_mocap_config.yaml: Change the frame_id from "local_origin" to "global_origin". Then, change the child_frame_id from "fcu" to "fcu_utm".
		2. In tf_bcast.cpp, cam2imu_publish() has sendTransform() at the end. Change "fcu" to "fcu_utm".
		3. Have transformPose() in tf_bcast.cpp and set "global_origin"

<Useful_commands_shortcuts_for_Ubuntu>
	1. ps -elf : To see what resources are running.
	2. find . | grep 'name'
	3. grep -R 'name' 
	4. dmesg : It tells what has changed with the USB ports.

<UTM_issues>
	1. GPS (Latitude and longitude to UTM coordinates converter)
		https://www.geoplaner.com
		http://www.synnatschke.de/geo-tools/coordinate-converter.php
	2. Coordinates
		1) In Pixhawk, NED (North-East-Down)
		2) In Mavros, ENU (East-North-Up)

<Rosbag_issues>
	1. Recording
		rosbag record -a -x "(.*)/compressed(.*)"
	2. Playing
		- time sync issue
			1) First, add <param name="/use_sim_time" value="true"/> in your launch file.
			2) rosbag play (bag file name) --clock --topics (rostopic names)

-<Git_submodules>
	1. When cloning, do the following: 
		git clone --recursive git@github.com:raaslab/mavros_mrmt_tracking.git

<ROS_Matlab_toolbox>
	1. Generate custom messages in Matlab for Ros
		- The most important!: you should start matlab with sudo.

<Everything_about_APM>
	1. Network password of reach:63:05 - emlidreach
		In order to check the wifi setup for Reach RTK, connect to RTK's wifi then go to http://192.168.42.1/
		If you can't see the wifi from your network, then it means RTK talks to the antenna, which is good.
	2. rosservice call /mavros/set_stream_rate 0 10 1
	3. RC modes
		1) Loiter mode = Position Hold
		2) Stabilization mode = Manual mode
	4. Mission Planner
		1) EK2_ALT_SOURCE: it selects which sensor we should rely on for altitude.

<Power_tips>
	- V must be met (if the adapter provides a higher voltage output, it can break the computer, and if the adapter provides a lower voltage output, it won't turn on the system). 
	- What matters is the power. Ampere just allows how much of system that can be running. The higher ampere you have, the higher performance system you can use.

<New_quad_setup_for_odroid> This is for Ubuntu 16.04 and Ros Kinetic
	- Ubuntu setup:
		1) To set up the sd card with ubuntu: (You should use Windows.)
			- use SD Formatter to format the sd card, and Win32DiskImager to put the image of Ubuntu on the sd card.
		2) References:
			How to install Ubuntu 16.04: http://shshsh.tistory.com/93
		  	How to format: https://sungwanim.blog.me/220859615186

  	- Install the mavros_mrmt_tracking ros package
  		1) Necessary files:
  			- Install git by "sudo apt-get install git-all".
  			- Install catkin build by folloing site "http://catkin-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html".
  		2) Flea3
			- From "https://www.ptgrey.com/support/downloads", should download FlyCapture ARMHF (FlyCapture 2.11.3.425 SDK - ARMHF - Ubuntu 16.04 (32-bit)).
			- Then, follow the steps from "http://www.ptgrey.com/KB/10357". However, since it doesn't give the required libraries for Ubuntu 16.04, install libraw1394-11 libgtkmm-2.4-1v5 libglademm-2.4-1v5 and libusb-1.0-0, as appeared in "http://www.ptgrey.com/KB/10548".
			- Check if the camera is recognized by odroid; do the following.
				cd <extraction folder>/FlyCapture-<version>-arm/bin
				export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=./../lib
				./FlyCap2_arm
		3) Important order of building packages!! (VERY IMPORTANT!)
			(1) flea3, camera_base
			(2) apriltags_ros
			(3) april_odom_tf
			(4) mavros, mavlink (as in the next subsection)
			(5) rest of packages
		4) Mavros
			Follow the instruction from "https://github.com/mavlink/mavros/blob/master/mavros/README.md#source-installation".

	- Issues:
		1) Odroid time and date issue:
			Do "sudo apt-get install ntp" and "sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata".
		2) Rosinstall_generator issue:
			When you see "bash: rosinstall_generator: command not found" error, then do the following.
			sudo apt-get update
			sudo apt-get install python-rosinstall-generator
		3) Flea3 ros package 
			(1) If you encounter this issue: libGLESv2.so.2: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
				sudo ln -s /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/mesa-egl/libGLESv2.so.2 /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libGLESv2.so.2
			(2) If you get this warning: Reconfigure callback failed with exception Failed to start capture | 33 Error starting isochronous stream.:
				sudo sh -c 'echo 1024 > /sys/module/usbcore/parameters/usbfs_memory_mb'
			(3) If you see libflycapture.so: file not recognized: File format not recognized, this means that you didn't install the Flea3 firmware yet. Install the firmware.

<tomlab> - For the SATA work
	- script_auto.m: main file.
	- script_data_extract.m: QMILP 
	- script_extract_rand_out.m: random primitive

<What_to_do>
	1. Quad (Arya)
		- Test outside again directly connecting the pixhawk to NUC. And see if the local position is subscribing to.
		- (Outside) connect the pixhawk of Sansa to NUC of Arya to see if the local position is subscribing to.
		- Use a new connector to odroid to see if the camera is recognized.
	
	2. Quad (Sansa)
		- Odroid:
			- Flea3 is finally working.
	
	3. SATA
		- Create a script that can draw graph instances in order to analyze Fig. 7.
	
	4. GM-PHD journal
		- Carry out an experiment.
	
	5. Paper works
		- Plan of study
		- I20
		- Tax return
		- icra registration
